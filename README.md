# ABTesting
An one of first projects with A/B-Testing, pandas and seaborn

in this case, I had data about the user ID and its total cost of purchases.  The data is distributed in 2 cases: before the site change and after, it was necessary 
to look and evaluate how much these changes affected users. Also check the probability that these changes could somehow affect the significance of the data
